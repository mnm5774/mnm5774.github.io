/* The point of this library was originally for ease of manipulation of the DOM.
I believe this will morph once I move to building my own single-page application.
Whether I use a framework or not, what I want is to understand the code itself,
and how it interacts with everything around it. The methods applied here can be called
by any objects created here, minimizing my code, and providing for a central place to
write new code. If I write my own framework for the front-end, the functionality
will most-likely reside here, being called and used by individual components and
modules throughout my file-structure. For the back-end, I should probably section
it off by itself for modularity, and understanding how things work, especially
if I use a Model-View-View-Model type process of rendering.

/* 4-5-18 : The purpose of things has changed from the above comment a bit, due
to my better understanding of a Single Page Application. The core purpose of this
will continue to be manipulation of the DOM, on a high level, and converting actual
DOM elements to a JS object. But the more foundational aspects (like dynamic rendering)
will be handled by my utils library. Separating this code will keep things cleaner,
I think, and easier to understand the flow of my application. This may not be advised in
a real-world situation. I don't know enough to tell for sure. This should help me
understand better how to go about building a large-scale application though, even with
another object-oriented language.

Another note: a second purpose for this library will be for a central place of storage
of code I learn and pick up as I do more study, and hands-on education.
